The main goal of this project is trying to run Rockstar halo catalogs on Dhalos in order to generate new merger trees with different initial redshifts. In order to do this, one needs to run find_descendants and build_trees. There are two python files created to run these using the Slurm queues.

The data used is located in "/home/arnes/UNIT/1Gpc_4096_fixedAmp_001_ROCKSTAR/". This data is already decompressed. The compressed data and the Rockstar+ConsistentTrees data is located in "/data5/UNITSIM/1Gpc_4096/fixedAmp_001/ROCKSTAR/tree/".
